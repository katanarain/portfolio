        <p>ABOUT DEVICE<br>A device meant to cool sea turtle nests until they reach a temperature range that will produce 100% male hatchlings to help rectify the sex ratio imbalance. The sex of a sea turtle is determined by the temperature of the sand in which the egg is incubated. Due to rising global temperatures, 99% of sea turtles born within the last 4 years have been female.
        <br><br>MY ROLE<br>Engineering consultant with our conservationist community partners. Ideated, modelled, built and tested the device with my engineering team. Ran temperature trials in-lab and in-field to verify thermal simulation data. Currently working on a DIY version of the device for developing countries to access the technology in a cost effective way.

        <p>ABOUT RESEARCH<br>The effect that increasing mixing time has on pancake fluffiness was investigated. ‘Fluffiness’, in this case, being thickness(mm) over compressive force(N) as a higher thickness and lower compressive force equate to higher fluffiness.
        <br><br>MY FINDINGS<br>The data found matches the original hypothesis that increasing mixer time will increase pancake fluffiness up to a certain point as you begin to overdevelop the gluten. Fluffiness reaches a maximum point around 42±6s of mixing time and will begin to decline rapidly when the batter is mixed for more than 60 seconds due to both a rapid increase in peak force and reduction in thickness.
